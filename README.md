# Python Platformer (Solo Portfolio Version)

A 2D platformer written in Python. This project was originally developed by a team of four at the beginning of my degree while learning python best practices, how to collaborate, work with Git, and read each other’s code. While it was intended to be evenly distributed across the team, I ended up taking on a larger share to help the project reach a completed state.

This repository is maintained as a solo portfolio version, focusing on the parts I implemented and my understanding of the full codebase.

## My Contributions

During the original group project, I was responsible for:
- Level design 
- Level implementation (loading and using level data from CSV files)
- Player implementation (movement and player logic)

## Other team members contributed to:
- Collision handling
- Character sprite creation
- Background and visual design

## Assets 
All visual assets used in this project (sprites, backgrounds, and tiles) were sourced from free-use / royalty-free asset libraries, we only wrote code and made no art assets.
